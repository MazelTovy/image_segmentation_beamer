# NYU Beamer Template for Undergraduate Thesis

It's based on [Kokura-Beamer](https://github.com/Falldio/Kokura-Beamer). I used it mainly because it's appealing cover.

The original NYU template is somewhat rigid, so I integrated blocks from the Madrid theme to refine its appearance to my aesthetic preferences.

To make edits, directly edit within the `.tex` file of the corresponding section.

To compile it, just

```
xelatex main.tex
```

or

```
lualatex main.tex
```

Here are some examples
